    Basically, you can think of a module as of a something (black box) 
    which can process `input` data and produce `ouput` data.
    This is like applying a function which is called `forward`: 
        
        output = module.forward(input)
    
    The module should be able to perform a backward pass: to differentiate the `forward` function. 
    More, it should be able to differentiate it if is a part of chain (chain rule).
    The latter implies there is a gradient from previous step of a chain rule.
